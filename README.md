# DNA-RNA-Hoogsteen-meta-eABF-and-MSM

Formation of Hoogsteen base pairing in DNA and RNA has been studeied using **meta-eABF** simulation and **Markov State Modeling (MSM)**.
The input files for constructing meta-eABF and MSM and the analysis and plotting scripts used for the study are provided here.
The project was performed as a part of my PhD research with Prof. Ioan Andricioaei at University of California, Irvine.
